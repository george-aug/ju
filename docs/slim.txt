Implementing Slim Image Cropper
===============================

Challenges
----------
Restricting users to upload only 3 images
Disabling edit button on server images
Naming of images uploaded
Saving it onto server
Persisting it into database
Deleting the uploaded images from DB as well as from server

Problems
---------
If you take meta data while using slim that is: data-meta-pic-id. The problem is when user delete the first
image second image shifts to position one


Notes:
------
Data Ratio is: width:height

How Deletion of Image works for Users
-------------------------------------
1. Deletion of server image by user
2. Deletion of image when user upload & edit same image during single session
Since the uid is attached to the image name every image name is unique
